        <h3><b>Favorite Short Poem and Food</b></h3>
        <p> This is a poem written by the father of my English teacher Dr. Berg. <br>
            <!--Insert Poem here-->
            As a group of 3, we put forward 3 meaningful <i>questions</i> and we are <br> 
            waiting for Dr. Berg's dad's answers.

        <p> My favorite food is <em>braised pork</em>. It is a meal invented by ancient Chineses people. <br>
            It can be cooked with quail eggs, bamboo shoots, or vegetarian chicken to form different cuisines <br>
            to make it more delicious.
